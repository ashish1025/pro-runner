# pro-runner

In this project I created an infinite runner game with a wall and ceiling using canvas api in javascript.
Clicking the space will switch the gravity and the runner will move to the opposite wall. The goal of the game is to survive the obstacles and increase the playerâ€™s score.
For the runner I have taken a square that keeps moving horizontally.  
I have added manually appearing obstacles in the floor and ceiling. If the runner touches the obstacle the game ends. 
As the points increase the runner moves faster and faster.
